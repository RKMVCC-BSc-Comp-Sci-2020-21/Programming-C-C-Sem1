    basic coding examples.
    We hope this repository helps you and makes your learning experience better. 
    
### Features:
* For better understanding of the programmes we have used comments to describe the features of the those specific lines of code.
* We made the programmes as simple as possible and tried to make it with the least complexity.
* The prgorammes are arranged according to dates and month (It's an example of abstraction.) 
* All of your forking or pull requests (if deemed necessary) will be added withing 2 or 3 hours of submission.
